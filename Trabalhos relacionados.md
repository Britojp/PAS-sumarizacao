#### Abstract  
Nos últimos anos, o volume de dados multimídia produzidos e disponíveis para acesso tem crescido contínua e rapidamente. Esse contexto agravou o problema da sobrecarga de informação: encontrar conteúdo de interesse em meio à grande quantidade de opções disponíveis, tornando essenciais sistemas que possibilitem acesso eficiente. A sumarização de vídeo é uma área de pesquisa que busca lidar com esse problema, fornecendo uma versão compacta e informativa do conteúdo. Em particular, os sistemas multimídia atuais disponibilizam diversos vídeos relacionados ao mesmo assunto, contendo informações complementares. Esse fato ressalta a importância da sumarização multivídeo para lidar com o interesse do usuário em se informar sobre determinado assunto a partir de um conjunto de vídeos que o abordam, sem a necessidade de assistir a todos eles. Entretanto, a análise da literatura mostra que estratégias humanas não são consideradas na definição dos critérios utilizados para selecionar automaticamente os segmentos de vídeo que irão compor os sumários e o foco das técnicas tem sido a identificação de informações que se repetem em diferentes vídeos. Assim, esta tese tem o objetivo de investigar se critérios para seleção de conteúdo derivados de estratégias humanas são capazes de produzir resultados semanticamente mais relevantes na visão do usuário. A pesquisa desenvolvida evidencia que a abordagem proposta possibilitou mapear os julgamentos de relevância dos usuários e gerar sumários multivídeo mais próximos a suas expectativas.

#### Abstract  
Automated analysis of surveillance video is necessary due to its redundant and uninteresting content. This has led to a rapidly evolving research area called video synopsis or otherwise called as rapid recap system. As the name suggests, it can highly condense a lengthy input surveillance video by extracting and shifting the moving objects in temporal axis and then displays them simultaneously in an non-overlapping fashion. This article investigates the prior arts for synopsis video generation for both single and multi-camera network. This article focuses on providing a brief introduction to the area of video synopsis by discussing the state-of-the-art techniques. Then the end of the article also focuses on a new trend in synopsis generation methods applied to the challenging area of multi-camera networks. This literature identifies various optimization techniques, dataset, and evaluation matrix used for each approach.

#### Abstract  
Most video summarization approaches have focused on extracting a summary from a single video; we propose an unsupervised framework for summarizing a collection of videos. We observe that each video in the collection may contain some information that other videos do not have, and thus exploring the underlying complementarity could be beneficial in creating a diverse informative summary. We develop a novel diversity-aware sparse optimization method for multi-video summarization by exploring the complementarity within the videos. Our approach extracts a multi-video summary, which is both interesting and representative in describing the whole video collection. To efficiently solve our optimization problem, we develop an alternating minimization algorithm that minimizes the overall objective function with respect to one video at a time while fixing the other videos. Moreover, we introduce a new benchmark data set, Tour20, that contains 140 videos with multiple manually created summaries, which were acquired in a controlled experiment. Finally, by extensive experiments on the new Tour20 data set and several other multi-view data sets, we show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the two problems-topic-oriented video summarization and multi-view video summarization in a camera network.

#### Abstract  
The volume of video data generated has seen an exponential growth over the years and video summarization has emerged as a process that can facilitate efficient storage, quick browsing, indexing, fast retrieval and quick sharing of the content. In view of the vast literature available on different aspects of video summarization approaches and techniques, a need has arisen to summarize and organize various recent research findings, future research focus and trends, challenges, performance measures and evaluation and datasets for testing and validations. This paper investigates into the existing video summarization frameworks and presents a comprehensive view of the existing approaches and techniques. It highlights the recent advances in the techniques and discusses the paradigm shift that has occurred over the last two decades in the area, leading to considerable improvement. Attempts are made to consolidate the most significant findings right from the basic summarization structure to the classification of summarization techniques and noteworthy contributions in the area. Additionally, the existing datasets categorized domain-wise for the purpose of video summarization and evaluation are enumerated. The present study would be helpful in: assimilating important research findings and data for ready reference, identifying groundwork and exploring potential directions for further research.

#### Abstract  
The exponential growth in video usage and accessibility in recent years has led to an increase in activities such as browsing, storing, indexing, sharing, and retrieval of video content. With a vast body of literature available on different aspects of video summarization approaches and techniques, there is a need to organize and outline diverse research findings, datasets, performance evaluation methods, future research directions, challenges and limitations. This paper aims to examine the current frameworks for video summarization and provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and techniques. It focuses on advancements in video summarization techniques such as Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), as well as the significant improvements resulting from the paradigm shift over the last seven years. A systematic research strategy is employed to holistically present findings ranging from the traditional video summarization structure to the classification of deep learning-based video summarization considering learning types, video datasets, video domains, evaluation metrics and significant contributions. Additionally, the paper compares and analyzes the most popular evaluation metric, F-Score. This paper aids in integrating important research findings to critically analyze recent advancements, identify future directions and limitations to establish foundations for comprehensive research. However, despite the advancements in video summarization approaches, there is a need for robust methods, scalability of summarization methods to handle the ever-growing volume of video content and standard evaluation metrics for assessing the effectiveness of summarization algorithms across different applications and domains.
